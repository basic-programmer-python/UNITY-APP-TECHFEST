# UNITY-APP-TECHFEST
This is the app developed using unity. Just for learning purpose. Its in a private mode.
BASIC IDEA
Basic idea of the game is that the player should escape the enemies and collect the coins that appear randomly. 
collecting 20 coins takes you to the next level.
As the levels increases the difficulty increases as well as the new powerups for the player will be introduced.

For every 5 levels a new enemy is introduced and a power up to face the enemy will also be introduced.
